# the-dee-sanction-roll20
My ersatz Roll20 character sheet for The Dee Sanction RPG. Until there's an official one.

This requires you to be able to use custom character sheets on Roll20, and hence have a "Pro" Roll20 account I believe.

Assuming you have that ability, you can use this character sheet by creating a game and choosing "custom" for the character sheet template.
If you click on your new game, you should be presented with a "settings" option, in which you should hopefully see a "Character Sheet Template" section.
You can simply paste the two files (html and css) into the two appropriate tabs and click "Save Changes". 

I created this to use purely in my own home game of The Dee Sanction, but am providing it publicly in case it's of use to anyone.

I've used the closest font I can find to that used in the draft PDF of the rulebook for the game logo. It's the closest I can find on Google Fonts. Let me know if you find a better one.

I've mucked around with a few of the spellings, such as adding an -e to Physicalle etc, changed "Hits" to "Hyttes", and "Unravelling" to "Unravellynge". I'll be GMing this for a history teacher whose favourite period is Tudor/early modern, so doubtless he'll weigh in on this, whether I like it or not.

I also added a "Notes & Miscellany" box, so players would have somewhere to jot random notes, and for me to paste in the output from @MrGarland4 on Twitter.

### TODO:

- Add buttons for rolling dice. This is tricky due to the "Step up/down a die" mechanic. I could simply have 3 buttons for each rollable thing (i.e. Physicall, Intellectuall, Supernaturall, Unravelling and Armour) but that feels a bit clunky.
- Turn Tradecraft into a radio button group, rather than a drop-down box.  This will make it look a bit more like the "real" charactersheet, and make it easier to hover over the items to see the tooltips.
- Prettify the 3 main statistics (Physicall, Intellectuall, Supernaturall). Currently they aren't laid out as they are on the "real" charactersheet, and it would be nice if they were the same, as I like the look of the real ones.
